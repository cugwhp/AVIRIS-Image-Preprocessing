PRO add_borders_aviris
;Created for images from the HyspIRI campaign (same area flown three times in 2013 and 2014).
;Images must have same number of bands and be in zero rotation (aka North to South - NO angle).
;Some files were not successfully resized using resize_plus_borders_aviris.pro due to various file issues.
;This Code reads in manually cropped images (using ENVI) and adds a 10 sample/line border to all sides the flightline that has a value of zero. 
;The resulting files will be a BSQ image that has the same number of samples and lines for all files in the flightline folder.
;This code outputs images that will be inputs for Alex Koltunov's Image to Image Registration code.
